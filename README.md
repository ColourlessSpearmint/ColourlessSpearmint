My name is **Ethan Marks**. I'm a 14-year-old college student and software engineer.
## Skills
- 🐍 My preferred language is **Python**, and I code most of [my projects](https://github.com/ColourlessSpearmint?tab=repositories) in it.
- 🎮 I have a fair bit of experience in **Game Development**; I published my [first game on itch.io](https://colourlessspearmint.itch.io/soaring-squirrel-shipment) when I was 11 years old.
- 🖥️ I've done some **Front-End** coding for a secret personal project involving a 🔑 **custom encryption protocol**.
- 🖌️ I taught myself **3D Modeling** in Blender in order to make assets for my 3D printer.

## About Me
- ⚙️ I love **automation**. The concept of non-trivial tasks being completed without human intervention is extremely satisfying to me and is the main reason I started programming in the first place.
- 💼 I run a **side-business** where I buy old laptops in bulk at auction, purchase and install new parts, flash new operating systems, and resell them for profit.
- 📚 My **favorite novels** are [Dune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune), [The Golden Compass](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119322.The_Golden_Compass), and [The Fifth Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41580260-the-fifth-science).
## What I'm Learning
- ☕ **Java/Kotlin**: I want to branch out from Python to another general-purpose language, and Kotlin seemed like a good choice. I'm still in the very early stages of learning Kotlin, so it'll be a while before I use it in a public repo.
- 🔦 **PyTorch**: I actually do have some [experience with PyTorch](https://github.com/ColourlessSpearmint/Mantis/blob/feature/rl/rl/train.py), but the code was mostly just copy-pasted and I didn't really know what I was doing. I have a good understanding of the principles of ML, but I'm still learning to implement it in practice.
- 🎭 **Collaboration**: I've always been a solo programmer (as evidenced by my activity overview: "100% commits"), but I'd love to collaborate on a project. [Raise an issue in my profile readme](https://github.com/ColourlessSpearmint/ColourlessSpearmint/issues/new?title=Contact%20Request&body=Hi%20@ColourlessSpearmint!%0A%0AI'm%20trying%20to%20reach%20you%20about:%20%0A&labels=contact&assignees=ColourlessSpearmint
